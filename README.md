# Data Analyst Nanodegree Repo

This repository is for lecture notes, projects and cheatsheets for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

# Projects Overview: 

## Project 1: Weather Trends 

Introductory project. The dataset contains global and local average temerature by year. The goal of the project was to compare local weather trends (in Kiev and in Moscow) and global weather trends and provide appropriate visualisations.

## Project W: Wikipedia Lab (Optional)

This project is inspired by one of the Udacity's lectures where the instructor shared an observation that if we keep clicking the first link on any Wikipedia page, we will end up at an article about Philosophy. I tried to reproduce that result. 

##Â Project 2: Bikeshare Analysis

This is guided analysis implemented in a question-answer format. The questions were provided by Udacity. The goal of the project is to perform EDA on the bikeshare data provided by bike-share system provider [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), specifically: compare system usage in New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC

## Project 3: No Show Medical Appointments in Brazil 

The goal of the project is to explore what factors influence if the patient shows up for their appointment. The dataset contains the data about 110,527 appointments and indicates whether the patient showed up. 

# Project 4: A/B Testing of a Website

The goal of the project is to perform an A/B test in order to understand whether the new landing page leads to better conversion rate.

# Project 5: The Stroop Effect 

The goal of this project is to analyse the results of the experiment that tested the Stroop effect - i.e. whether it really takes longer to read the name of the colour if the colour of the words is incongruent with the word itself. 

# Project 6: Online News Popularity  

The goal of the project is to analyze if we can find any factors that influence news popularity measured in the number of shares. For this project I took a dataset from UCI that contains about 39K records from Mashable.com
